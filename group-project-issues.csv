Return book view,"This view should only be accessible in the ""customer"" state.

The user should return his 4-digit code that he received in the borrow book - view earlier, and it should then be returned.
Due to how our limited backend works, this can not be implemented in the best way possible, but come up with a way how you can check whether or not the 4digit code is correct, and then the book should be returned. 
Also have a way to let the user know if his 4 digit code is wrong, and make him try again.
