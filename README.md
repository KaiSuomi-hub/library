# Group project

In this project you will develop a fancy fake library application with React and json-server.

The library application will have 2 different states for different users: customers and admins.
Usually this kind of view or role handling is done through permissions and roles for the user that is logged in, but since we don't have time to go through authentication, we'll use another way.

The actual UI design is left to you. Just make sure every view implements the given requirements in the issue. Also give the UI a suitable outlook.

Only a part of the db.json file that is needed is given. Rest you will have to figure out within your group.
Also remember that this db.json won't be similar between all of you unless you share it over git, as the database is local to your system.

### **Remember to define PropTypes for each component!**

The goal of this project is to teach basics of working as a team in a software development project, as well as learning more about doing front-end development.

## Duration

Length of this group project is 1 week (30.5.-3.6.)

## How to work

### Monday:

-   Presentation of the task
-   Planning phase, make a plan (preferably with drawings (either with paint or with handdrawings) of the user interface. Remember how it went last time in the group project, and modify planning if needed :)
-   Make a division of tasks, who completes what task
-   Start working

### Tuesday:

-   Have a scrum daily meeting, decide the time of that within your group. Oskari will participate
    to keep an eye on the progress and guide the conversation if necessary
-   Continue with the project

### Wednesday:

-   Have a scrum daily meeting, adjust plan if necessary. Oskari will participate
-   Continue with the project

### Thursday:

-   Scrum daily meeting. Oskari will participate
-   Continue with the project

### Friday:

-   Scrum daily meeting
-   Sprint review at your groups given time (between 10am - 12pm). Make sure you have a working version in the 'master' branch at this point.
-   Last lecture of the frontend section of this training. Next week practice at the company starts

# Working as a team

-   This is a team effort, even when you have individual tasks. It's your team's goal to complete all tasks, or as many tasks as possible, before the end of the sprint.

### Merge requests

-   When you have completed a task, other teammembers should review your merge request. If there are comments/points raised, fix those, and once other teammembers have accepted (thumbs up) your merge request, then press merge.
-   If a teammember raises a point, discuss the point with your teammate if unsure what it means.
-   Remember that you are all learning in this project. Raising a point in your teammates code is never personal, and don't take it as such.

### If you run into problems

-   Discuss with your team when you run into problems and try to solve the problem with your team. Very often just talking about the problem helps you find a way to solve it.
-   If you have discussed the problem as a team, and are still unable to come up with a solution, don't hesitate to ask Oskari for help/guidance.
